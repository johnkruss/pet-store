A repo to demonstrate code structures and testing practices that can effectively document and demonstrate code

Project created with Java 17, Micronaut 3.5.3, Kotest 5.4.1, and of course docker

To build/test - 

First run `docker compose up -d` to pull and start up a container running localstack

Localstack is a convenient, mostly open source, container based AWS emulator that provides a bunch of 
convenient services to test against

From there simple run `./gradlew build` to see tests executed
